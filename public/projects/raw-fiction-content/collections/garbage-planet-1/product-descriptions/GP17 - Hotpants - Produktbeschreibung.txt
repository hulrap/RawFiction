Sustainability: 
Our hotpants are handcrafted in Vienna, Austria with love. 
The fabric consists of pure GOTS certified linen. While we do not own a certificate on our own, the sourcing with GOTS certified materials ensures high environmental and social standards throughout the whole production chain involved in creating a fabric. 
By producing in our hometown Vienna and with its high social standards, we can guarantee fairness during the making of our garments. In order to sew our clothes without causing microplastic waste, we are using GOTS certified cotton yarns. This ensures that the hotpants are fully biodegradable. The metal buttons are made from stainless steel, which is 100% recyclable. To offset the CO2 emissions involved in the creation of these hotpants and components, we are estimating their impact and purchasing CO2 allowances, as well as planting a tree for every pair of pants sold, through trustworthy programs. 


Features: 
Our hotpants are Unisex, but with a feminine touch. Besides the cotton yarn they are 100% made out of woven black heavy-duty linen fabric, featuring steel buttons and a pocket on the front and left sideline. The model (180cm) displayed above has a medium stature. These hotpants are very stable and robust due to the heavy-duty fabric. .

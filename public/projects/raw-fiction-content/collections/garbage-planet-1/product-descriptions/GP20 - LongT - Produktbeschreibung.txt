Sustainability: 
Our long T is handcrafted in Vienna, Austria with love. 
The fabric consists of pure GOTS certified linen. While we do not own a certificate on our own, the sourcing with GOTS certified materials ensures high environmental and social standards throughout the whole production chain involved in creating a fabric. 
By producing in our hometown Vienna and with its high social standards, we can guarantee fairness during the making of our garments. In order to sew our clothes without causing microplastic waste, we are using GOTS certified cotton yarns. This ensures that the long T is fully biodegradable. The metal button is made from stainless steel, which is 100% recyclable, the handcrafted agent badge is made from old damaged tin dishes and can be recycled too. To offset the CO2 emissions involved in the creation of this long T and components, we are estimating their impact and purchasing CO2 allowances, as well as planting a tree for every shirt sold, through trustworthy programs. 


Features: 
Our long T is Unisex. Besides the cotton yarn it is 100% made out of woven black linen fabric. The model (175cm) displayed above has a medium stature. The shirt features a metal button on the backside of the neck. Our long T is a nice all-year item, cooling in summer and warming in winter.

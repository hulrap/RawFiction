Sustainability: 
Our armour is cut and finished in Austria by the artist Martijn Straatman (www.studiotinus.com) and the ring mesh is created by Ziegler Metallgewebe in Germany. They are covering 45% of their energy consumption from their own solar panels and to offset the other 55% of CO2 emissions involved in the creation of our armour and components, we are estimating their impact and purchasing CO2 allowances. Additionally we are planting 10 trees for every armour piece sold, through trustworthy programs. The stainless steel of our product can be fully recycled and the metal badge (tin) too, which is accounted for in our CO2 estimation and the rubber/cotton band is able to biodegrade.  


Features: 
Our armour is Unisex. The ring mesh is made out of stainless steel with outer ring size 7mm, inner size 5,4mm and 0,8mm diameter and the mesh weighs 3.15kg/sqm. The outer lines are finished with a cotton/rubber band. The model (170cm) displayed above has a medium stature and the piece can be worn from both sides. The armour vest is the right choice as a flashy outfit for occasions where you want to stand out and be noticed.

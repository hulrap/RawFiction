Sustainability: 
Our jumpsuit is handcrafted in Vienna, Austria with love. 
The fabric consists of pure GOTS certified hemp, produced in Europe. While we do not own a certificate on our own, the sourcing with GOTS certified materials ensures high environmental and social standards throughout the whole production chain involved in creating a fabric. 
By producing in our hometown Vienna and with its high social standards, we can guarantee fairness during the making of our garments. In order to sew our clothes without causing microplastic waste, we are using GOTS certified cotton yarns. This ensures that the jumpsuit is fully biodegradable. The handcrafted agent badge is made from old damaged tin dishes and can be recycled. To offset the CO2 emissions involved in the creation of this jumpsuit and components, we are estimating their impact and purchasing CO2 allowances, as well as planting a tree for every jumpsuit sold, through trustworthy programs.  


Features: 
Our jumpsuit is Unisex. Besides the cotton yarn, they are 100% made out of european hemp denim with 345g/sqm. The model (175cm) displayed above has a medium stature. The jumpsuit stands out by its interpretation from industrial workwear to avant garde-streetwear. No need to match your outfit.

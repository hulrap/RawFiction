Sustainability: 
Our wrap pants are handcrafted in Vienna, Austria with love. 
The fabric consists of pure GOTS certified organic cotton. While we do not own a certificate on our own, the sourcing with GOTS certified materials ensures high environmental and social standards throughout the whole production chain involved in creating a fabric. 
By producing in our hometown Vienna and with its high social standards, we can guarantee fairness during the making of our garments. In order to sew our clothes without causing microplastic waste, we are using GOTS certified cotton yarns. This ensures that the wrap pants are fully biodegradable. To offset the CO2 emissions involved in the creation of these wrap pants and components, we are estimating their impact and purchasing CO2 allowances, as well as planting a tree for every pair sold, through trustworthy programs.
